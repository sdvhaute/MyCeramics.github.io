# Note: Remember that these are important credentials 
# that allow one to easily access your Cloudinary account. 
# Make sure that they are not exposed anywhere.
#  Donâ€™t save them in an online repository by any means. 
#  I would rather recommend that you add a .gitignore file and include the .env file there. 
#  Always enable GitGuardian to check for any exposed keys in your project.
